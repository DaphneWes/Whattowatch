# What to watch assessment

## Code

I tried to use as much loops as I could to make the code more compact. Also, the quiz is really dynamic through a random genre picker and then pick a random poster from the first page of the results. Therefore, everytime you do the quiz you get different posters.

## Interactieontwerp

I think my webapp is very easy to use. The buttons are clearly visible and have appropriate names to know what they do. Also, you cannot submit the quiz before every question is answered (required attribute is used). From the navigation bar you can get to almost all pages and it is therefore not hard to find what you are looking for.

## Repository

The github repository is organised with the use of different folders (templates, styles etc.) and therefore easy to understand. 

## Projectdocumentatie

The read.me file contains all the information on what is needed to run the webapp. The design.me file shows what my thoughts were beforehand and how I was gonna make the webapp and its features but also the details of the final product. Process.md contains all the information on my process of making this webapp and I think it went really good with no significant problems.

## Decisions

The biggest decision that I made is to keep the quiz smaller than I had anticipated. I saw that if I used too many variables for the search in the database, I would get a kind of counterproductive result (only a few movies or none at all). Then I thought about maybe counting how many times a genre is chosen (in different questions of the quiz) but then for it to be distinguishable (not like every question leads to a different genre) it had to be quite a long quiz. That was not what I wanted because nobody wants to do a long quiz to find a movie (it should be fun).
